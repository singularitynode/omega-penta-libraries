# ⚡ Omega Penta Libraries

**Enterprise-Grade Distributed Systems Libraries for Python**  
Built for scale. Designed for resilience. Powered by coherence.

---

## 🌌 Overview

Omega Penta Libraries is a **suite of five modular, production-grade system components** for building distributed, fault-tolerant, and self-healing Python architectures.

Each library is lightweight, async-ready, and interoperable — forming a cohesive backbone for modern service-oriented infrastructure.

---

## 🧩 The Five Omega Libraries

### 🧠 1. `omega_domain.querycache` — *Automatic Data Mesh*
> ⚙️ Problem: Repeated slow queries across microservices.

**Features**
- Federated Query Caching  
- Hybrid Redis + Memory Data Mesh  
- Field-level Resolution & Cache Partitioning  
- TTL-based Invalidation  
- Pluggable Serializer / Resolver Interfaces  

---

### 🌐 2. `omega_infra.gate` — *Distributed Rate Limiter*
> ⚙️ Problem: Local-only throttling and inconsistent limits.

**Features**
- Token Bucket Algorithm with Cluster Consensus  
- Dynamic Rate Adaptation  
- Global Usage Ledger via Redis  
- Per-Endpoint and Per-User Limits  
- Plug-in Ready Backend Design  

---

### 🛡️ 3. `omega_infra.circuitbreaker` — *Adaptive Protection System*
> ⚙️ Problem: Cascading failures under high load.

**Features**
- Finite State Machine (`CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN`)  
- Self-healing and Auto Reset  
- Async-Aware Function Decorator  
- Immutable Key Safeguards  
- Real-Time Health Metrics  
- Dynamic Threshold Reconfiguration  

---

### 🧱 4. `omega_domain.snapshotter` — *Aggregate Root Persistence*
> ⚙️ Problem: Event replay bottlenecks in CQRS/Event Sourcing.

**Features**
- Periodic State Snapshots  
- Delta-based Optimization  
- Rehydration Engine for Event Stores  
- Auto Snapshot Triggers  
- Multi-backend Compatibility (Redis, SQLAlchemy, FS)  

---

### ⚙️ 5. `omega_infra.shard` — *Consistent Hashing Router*
> ⚙️ Problem: Data routing rebalancing across distributed nodes.

**Features**
- Consistent Hashing with Virtual Nodes  
- Smooth Topology Reconfiguration  
- Load-Weighted Node Distribution  
- Stateless Router Design  
- Shard Introspection Utilities  

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install redis asyncio
Basic usage example:

python
Copy code
from omega_infra.circuitbreaker import CircuitBreaker

circuit_breaker = CircuitBreaker("payment_gateway")

@circuit_breaker.protect
async def call_external_service():
    return await your_api_call()
🧠 Architecture Philosophy
Omega Penta was engineered on three core principles:

Deterministic Resilience — Systems should recover autonomously.

Distributed Coherence — Shared state remains synchronized without central coordination.

Composable Independence — Each module stands alone yet scales in unison.

Together, they form the foundation for next-generation fault-tolerant distributed systems.

⚙️ Advanced Features (Omega Core Extensions)

Omega MeshLink – Transparent inter-service mesh layer for cross-cluster discovery

NeuroCache Engine – Adaptive caching using time-decayed access frequency

Self-Tuning Rate Gates – Learns optimal throttling per endpoint via feedback loop

Quantum Shard Router – Consistent hashing + stochastic rebalancing (entropy-aware)

Snapshot AutoPrune – Retains only deltas beyond entropy threshold

Omega Provenance Chain – Commit signing + package-level trust verification

Async + Threadsafe Design – Built for concurrency, tested in asyncio and trio

🧩 Integration Example: Enterprise Setup
from omega_infra.gate import DistributedRateLimiter
from omega_infra.circuitbreaker import CircuitBreaker
from omega_domain.querycache import QueryCache

rate_limiter = DistributedRateLimiter(global_limit=5000)
circuit = CircuitBreaker("external_api")
cache = QueryCache(ttl=30)

@rate_limiter.limit
@circuit.protect
@cache.cached
async def get_customer_data(user_id):
    return await fetch_from_microservices(user_id)

🌌 Vision: Self-Evolving Infrastructure

Omega Penta is designed not just to run your systems, but to learn from them.
Every component carries feedback telemetry to optimize its own parameters — evolving toward zero-downtime distributed intelligence.
