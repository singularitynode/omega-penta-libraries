# Omega Penta Libraries

Enterprise-Grade Distributed Systems Libraries for Python  
**Version 1.0.0** — Modular, fault-tolerant, and production-ready tools for scalable backend architectures.

---

## Overview

**Omega Penta Libraries** is a suite of **five interlinked Python libraries** designed to provide a solid foundation for modern, distributed systems.  
Each module addresses a specific layer of reliability, consistency, or scalability commonly faced by backend, DevOps, and data engineering teams.

These libraries were designed with **resilience**, **low-latency performance**, and **operational transparency** in mind — drawing from production patterns in companies like Netflix, Uber, and Meta.

## The Five Omega Libraries

### 1. `omega_domain.querycache` — Intelligent Data Mesh Caching

**Problem Solved:** Slow, repetitive, or cross-service queries that lead to network congestion and latency spikes.

**Core Features**
- Automatic distributed query federation  
- In-memory + Redis hybrid caching  
- Field-level dependency tracking and invalidation  
- Async query resolver for concurrent data fetching  

**Example**
```python
from omega_domain.querycache import QueryCache

cache = QueryCache(ttl=60)

@cache.resolve("user_data")
async def get_user_data(user_id):
    return await fetch_user_from_db(user_id)

# Cached federated query
result = await cache.query("user_data", user_id=123)
2. omega_infra.gate — Distributed Rate Limiter
Problem Solved: Localized throttling without global awareness in microservice environments.

Core Features

Token Bucket and Leaky Bucket modes

Cluster-wide synchronization via Redis

Dynamic rule updates and hot reload

Supports asyncio for concurrent workloads

Example

python
Copy code
from omega_infra.gate import RateLimiter

limiter = RateLimiter("payment_api", limit=100, per=60)

async def call_api():
    async with limiter:
        await send_payment_request()
3. omega_infra.circuitbreaker — Adaptive Fault Protection
Problem Solved: Cascading failures across dependent services.

Core Features

State Machine: OPEN / HALF_OPEN / CLOSED

Self-healing with adaptive thresholds

Real-time metrics and failure analytics

Configurable fallback mechanisms

Example

python
Copy code
from omega_infra.circuitbreaker import CircuitBreaker

cb = CircuitBreaker("email_service")

@cb.protect
async def send_email():
    return await smtp_send_async()
4. omega_domain.snapshotter — Aggregate Root Snapshotting
Problem Solved: Event-sourced systems become slow with large event histories.

Core Features

Automatic periodic snapshot generation

Optimized replay engine for historical recovery

Event compaction and retention policy

Seamless integration with CQRS and DDD patterns

Example

python
Copy code
from omega_domain.snapshotter import Snapshotter

snap = Snapshotter("orders")

await snap.take_snapshot(entity_id="ORD-1001", state=current_state)
await snap.restore_snapshot("ORD-1001")
5. omega_infra.shard — Consistent Hashing Router
Problem Solved: Data rebalancing pain and uneven load during cluster scaling.

Core Features

Consistent Hashing algorithm with virtual nodes

Near-zero downtime when scaling nodes

Deterministic routing for horizontal partitioning

Minimal rebalancing overhead

Example

python
Copy code
from omega_infra.shard import ShardRouter

router = ShardRouter(nodes=["A", "B", "C"])
target = router.route("customer:1234")
